In general, it can be observed that the value of the attributes with the floods have moderate and strong correlations. Demonstrating that there is potential to submit data to classification algorithms.

In general, it can be observed that the value of the attributes with the floods have moderate and strong correlations. In this context, it is clear that data has potential for algorithms.

In possession of primary analysis, the next step is to prepare the data for Machine Learning algorithms, optimize data quality and detect outliers.
