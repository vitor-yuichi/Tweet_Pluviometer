\chapter{OBJECTIVES}\label{Obj}

This research project has as main objective the development of a method for flood forecasting based on Machine Learning techniques, temporal data extracted from Tweets, meteorological radar and rain gauges.

In addition, more specific goals are:

{%\singlespace
\begin{enumerate}%[i --]
\item Analyze and define the best performing Machine Learning algorithm for flood prediction based on data extracted from Tweets and meteorological instruments (weather radar and rain gauges);

\item Investigate the attributes (i.e., data from Tweets, weather radar, rain gauges and/or derivatives) of greatest relevance for flood prediction; 

\item Structure and make available in a public repository the databases used and source codes implemented in the research;

\item Disseminate the results obtained at scientific events and journals.
\end{enumerate}
