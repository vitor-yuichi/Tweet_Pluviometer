\chapter{OBJECTIVES}\label{Obj}


%This research project has as main objective the development of a method for flood forecasting based on Machine Learning techniques, temporal data extracted from Tweets, meteorological radar and rain gauges.
The primary purpose of this report is to perform an exploratory and statistical analysis on rainfall, radar, Twitter and flooding data, determining correlations and statistical distribution of attributes.

As more specific objectives, it consisted of data processing and generation of a single file integrating all databases used in the research. Analyzing the result of filtering tweets regarding the general context of the posts.
%In addition, more specific goals are:

%{%\singlespace
%\begin{enumerate}%[i --]
%\item Analyze and define the best performing Machine Learning algorithm for flood prediction based on data extracted from Tweets and meteorological instruments (weather radar and rain gauges);

%\item Investigate the attributes (i.e., data from Tweets, weather radar, rain gauges and/or derivatives) of greatest relevance for flood prediction; 

%\item Structure and make available in a public repository the databases used and source codes implemented in the research;

%\item Disseminate the results obtained at scientific events and journals.
%\end{enumerate}
