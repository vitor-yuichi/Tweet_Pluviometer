FIRST ANALYSIS (1.0)
In the first analysis of tweets, we tried to find a relation between several parameters
(duration, fidelity, strength, frequency of flooding) through dispersion plots and bars (tag 1.0).
SECOND ANALYSIS (2.0)
Based on the first analysis, this version of the tweets code will establish statistical relation (linear regression) between the parameters 
(Fidelity/strength, temporal window, frequence of word)
